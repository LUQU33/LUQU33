<h1 style="display: inline-block">Hi, I'm Pedro Luque</h1>

👨‍💻 Hi, I'm Pedro — a fullstack developer with a frontend orientation. I specialize in building clean, dynamic, and intuitive interfaces using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, complemented by solid backend knowledge with Node.js and MongoDB to deliver complete and scalable solutions.

🚀 I'm committed to continuous growth and always striving to improve. I'm especially interested in projects that challenge me to apply my skills in real-world scenarios, enhance code quality, and deliver meaningful user experiences. 

📚 I'm currently in my final year of the University Degree in Programming at UTN (Universidad Tecnológica Nacional), where I've built a strong foundation in logic, data structures, and programming with C and C++.
